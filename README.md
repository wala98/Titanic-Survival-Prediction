# ðŸš¢ Titanic Survival Prediction
Python Â· Machine Learning Â· Scikit-Learn

This project tackles the Titanic survival prediction problem using classic machine learning techniques. It follows a complete data science workflow â€” from data cleaning and exploration to feature engineering and model evaluation.

ðŸŽ¯ **Goal**  
Predict which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck using data such as age, gender, class, and fare.

## ðŸŒŸ Motivation

The Titanic dataset is one of the most iconic beginner-friendly datasets in data science. This project helps build essential ML skills like:

- Data preprocessing
- Handling missing values
- Feature encoding and scaling
- Model training and evaluation

---

## ðŸ“¦ Features

- Data analysis and visualization (Seaborn, Matplotlib)
- Handling of missing and categorical data
- Feature engineering for better prediction accuracy
- Multiple classifiers compared (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, etc.)
- Model evaluation using confusion matrices and accuracy scores

---

## ðŸ—ƒ Dataset

Titanic dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data):

- `train.csv` â€” training set with features and labels  
- `test.csv` â€” testing set for final prediction  
- Features include passenger class, sex, age, fare, etc.

## ðŸ§  Models Used

This project evaluates the performance of:

1. Logistic Regression
2. Decision Tree Classifier
3. KNN
4. Linear  and non Linear SVM classifier
5.  Decision Tree
6. ANN 

Each model is trained and evaluated to find the best approach.
